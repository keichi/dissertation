abstract = {Following the first full year of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data taking, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) computing environment built to support LHC data processing and analysis has been validated. In this review, I discuss the rationale for the design of a distributed system and describe how this environment was constructed and deployed through the use of grid computing technologies. I discuss the experience with large-scale testing and operation with real accelerator data, which shows that expectations have been met and sometimes exceeded. The computing system's key achievements are that (a) the WLCG infrastructure is distributed and makes use of all the dispersed resources, (b) the experiments' computing models are also distributed and can make excellent use of the infrastructure, and (c) the computing system has enabled physics output in a very short time. Finally, I present prospects for the future evolution of the WLCG infrastructure.},

abstract = {Big-Data applications need to shuffle their data over a network in a very large amount. The ability to efficiently allocate network resources to quickly finish the shuffle greatly affects the overall processing speed of Big-Data applications. The recent emergence of software-defined networking (SDN) technology makes it easier for the network to integrate with a Big- Data application. The network can allocate network resources based on an application's run-time requirements to accelerate the speed of Big-Data delivery. In this paper, we used Hadoop as a Big-Data application platform and designed an application-aware SDN routing scheme for Hadoop to accelerate its MapReduce data shuffling over a network. Our results show that our method can outperform the ECMP-RR scheme by up to 20{\%} and outperform the Spanning Tree method and the Floodlight OpenFlow controller by up to 70{\%}.},

abstract = {This whitepaper proposes OpenFlow: a way for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use ev- ery day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage network- ing vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on hetero- geneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too.},

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

abstract = {The fat tree topology with multipath capability has been used in many recent data center networks (DCNs) for increased bandwidth and fault tolerance. Traditional routing protocols have only limited support for multipath routing, and cannot fully utilize the available bandwidth in such networks. In this paper, we study multipath routing for fat tree networks. We formulate the problem as a linear program and prove its NP-completeness. We propose a practical solution, which takes advantage of the emerging software-defined networking paradigm. Our algorithm relies on a central controller to collect necessary network state information in order to make optimized routing decisions. We implemented the algorithm as an OpenFlow controller module and validated it with Mininet emulation. We also developed a fluid-based DCN simulator and conducted experiments, which show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional multipath algorithm based on random assignments, both in terms of increased throughput and in reduced end-to-end delay.},

abstract = {The steadily increasing number of nodes in high-performance computing systems and the technology and power constraints lead to sparse network topologies. Efficient mapping of ap- plication communication patterns to the network topology gains importance as systems grow to petascale and beyond. Such mapping is supported in parallel programming frame- works such as MPI, but is often not well implemented. We show that the topology mapping problem is NP-complete and analyze and compare different practical topology map- ping heuristics. We demonstrate an efficient and fast new heuristic which is based on graph similarity and show its util- ity with application communication patterns on real topolo- gies. Our mapping strategies support heterogeneous net- works and show significant reduction of congestion on torus, fat-tree, and the PERCS network topologies, for irregular communication patterns. We also demonstrate that the ben- efit of topology mapping grows with the network size and show how our algorithms can be used in a practical setting to optimize communication performance. Our efficient topol- ogy mapping strategies are shown to reduce network con- gestion by up to 80{\%}, reduce average dilation by up to 50{\%}, and improve benchmarked communication performance by 18{\%}.},

abstract = {The understanding of the interactions among processes of a High Performance Computing (HPC) system can be made easier if trace analysis is used. Traces, however, can be quite large, making it difficult to analyze their content unless some abstraction is provided. This paper presents a novel trace abstraction approach that aims to facilitate the analysis of large execution traces generated from HPC applications. Our approach allows automatic segmentation of large traces into smaller and meaningful clusters that reflect the various execution phases of the traced scenarios. Our approach is based on the application of information theory principles to the analysis of sequences of communication patterns extracted from traces of HPC systems. This work is inspired by recent studies in the field of bioinformatics where several techniques have been proposed to segment DNA sequences into homogeneous sub-domains, where each sub-domain exhibits a certain degree of internal homogeneity. Trace segments can be used in a number of applications such as recovering high-level views of the system behavior and program understanding. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to different traces of hundreds of millions of events, generated from two HPC systems.},

abstract = {As the size of today{\&}{\#}x02019;s supercomputers grow exponentially in numbers of processors, the applications that run on these systems scale to larger processor counts. The majority of these applications commonly use Message Passing Interface (MPI); a trace of these MPI communication events is an important input to the tools that visualize, simulate for performance modeling, or enable tuning of parallel applications. We introduce an efficient, accurate and flexible trace-driven performance modeling and prediction tool, PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s Open Source Interconnect and Network Simulator (PSINS), for MPI applications. A principal feature of PSINS is its usability for applications that scale up to large processor counts. PSINS generates compact and tractable event traces for fast and efficient simulations while producing accurate performance predictions. PSINS was incorporated into PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s automated performance prediction framework and used to model three applications from the High Performance Computing Modernization Program{\&}{\#}x02019;s (HPCMP) Technology Insertion 2009 (TI-09) application suite.},

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation, usage and experience with the MPI performance revealing extension interface (Peruse) into the Open MPI implementation. While the PMPI-interface allows timing MPI-functions through wrappers, it can not provide MPI-internal information on MPI-states and lower-level network performance. We introduce the general design criteria of the interface implementation and analyze the overhead generated by this functionality. To support performance evaluation of large-scale applications, tools for visualization are imperative. We extend the tracing library of the Paraver-toolkit to support tracing Peruse-events and show how this helps detecting performance bottlenecks. A test-suite and a real-world application are traced and visualized using Paraver. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Multiple implementations of MPI have been developed. In this paper, we describe MPICH, unique among existing implementations in its design goal of combining portability with high performance. We document its portability and performance and describe the architecture by which these features are simultaneously achieved. We also discuss the set of tools that accompany the free distribution of MPICH, which constitute the beginnings of a portable parallel programming environment. A project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about parallel computing, the specification being followed, the current hardware and software environment for parallel computing, and project management; we describe those we have learned. Finally, we discuss future developments for MPICH, including those necessary to accommodate extensions to the MPI Standard now being contemplated by the MPI Forum.},

Each BG/Q node has 68 hardware threads. Hybrid programming paradigms, which use message passing among nodes and multi-threading within nodes, enable applications to achieve high throughput on BG/Q. In this paper, we present scalable algorithms to optimize MPI collective operations by taking advantage of the various features of the BG/Q torus and collective networks. We achieve an 8 byte double-sum MPI{\_}Allreduce latency of 10.25 ms on 1,572,864 MPI ranks. We accelerate summing of network packets with local buffers by the use of the Quad Processing SIMD unit in the BG/Q cores and executing the sums on multiple communication threads supported by the optimized communication libraries. The achieved net gain is a peak throughput of 6.3 GB/s for double-sum allreduce. We also achieve over 90{\%} of network peak for MPI{\_}Alltoall with 65,536 MPI ranks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Task mapping is an important problem in parallel and distributed computing. The goal in task mapping is to find an optimal layout of the processes of an application (or a task) onto a given network topology. We target this problem in the context of staging applications. A staging application consists of two or more parallel applications (also referred to as staging tasks) which run concurrently and exchange data over the course of computation. Task mapping becomes a more challenging problem in staging applications, because not only data is exchanged between the staging tasks, but also the processes of a staging task may exchange data with each other. We propose a novel method, called Task Graph Embedding (TGE), that harnesses the observable graph structures of parallel applications and network topologies. TGE employs a machine learning based algorithm to find the best representation of a graph, called an embedding, onto a space in which the task-To-processor mapping problem can be solved. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of TGE experimentally with the communication patterns extracted from runs of XGC, a large-scale fusion simulation code, on Titan.},

abstract = {Evolving technology and increasing pin-bandwidth motivate the use of high-radix routers to reduce the diameter, latency, and cost of interconnection networks. High-radix networks, however, require longer cables than their low-radix counterparts. Because cables dominate network cost, the number of cables, and particularly the number of long, global cables should be minimized to realize an efficient network. In this paper, we introduce the dragonfly topology which uses a group of high-radix routers as a virtual router to increase the effective radix of the network. With this organization, each minimally routed packet traverses at most one global channel. By reducing global channels, a dragonfly reduces cost by 20{\%} compared to a flattened butterfly and by 52{\%} compared to a folded Clos network in configurations with ges 16K nodes.We also introduce two new variants of global adaptive routing that enable load-balanced routing in the dragonfly. Each router in a dragonfly must make an adaptive routing decision based on the state of a global channel connected to a different router. Because of the indirect nature of this routing decision, conventional adaptive routing algorithms give degraded performance. We introduce the use of selective virtual-channel discrimination and the use of credit round-trip latency to both sense and signal channel congestion. The combination of these two methods gives throughput and latency that approaches that of an ideal adaptive routing algorithm.},

abstract = {Understanding the characteristics and requirements of applications that run on commodity clusters is key to properly configuring current machines and, more importantly, procuring future systems effectively. There are only a few studies, however, that are current and characterize realistic workloads. For HPC practitioners and researchers, this limits our ability to design solutions that will have an impact on real systems. We present a systematic study that characterizes applications with an emphasis on communication requirements. It includes cluster utilization data, identifying a representative set of ap- plications from a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory, and characterizing their communication requirements. The driver for this work is understanding application sensitivity to a tapered fat-tree network. These results provided key insights into the procurement of our next generation commodity systems. We believe this investigation can provide valuable input to the HPC community in terms of workload characterization and requirements from a large supercomputing center.},

abstract = {We present our experiences to date building ONOS (Open Network Operating System), an experimental distributed SDN control platform motivated by the performance, scal- ability, and availability requirements of large operator net- works. We describe and evaluate two ONOS prototypes. The first version implemented core features: a distributed, but logically centralized, global network view; scale-out; and fault tolerance. The second version focused on improving performance. Based on experience with these prototypes, we identify additional steps that will be required for ONOS to support use cases such as core network traffic engineering and scheduling, and to become a usable open source, dis- tributed network OS platform that the SDN community can build upon},
