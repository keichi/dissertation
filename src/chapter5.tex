\section{Concluding Remark}
% 問題
The inter-process communication of applications running on cluster systems
show distinctive patterns. However, in contrast to the application-dependent
communication pattern, the interconnect is inherently designed in an
application-agnostic manner because a real-world cluster is usually shared by
many users and each user runs various applications. Therefore, in As a result,
the imbalance of the packet flow in the interconnect can occur under a
particular combination of communication pattern and interconnect. This
imbalance can lead to traffic congestion on a link in the interconnect, which
slows down communication and as a result degrades the total application
performance.

% 目的
This dissertation tackled this imbalance problem by adapting the interconnect
to the communication pattern of applications. Traditionally, such dynamic
adaptation of the interconnect has been deemed infeasible due to the lack of a
networking architecture, technology, or technique that allows flexible and
dynamic reconfiguration. However, the recent emergence of programmable
networking architecture that allows flexible and dynamic reconfiguration.
However, the recent emergence of programmable networking architectures
exemplified by Software-Defined Networking~(SDN) has opened up the possibility
to realize such adaptation. This dissertation aimed to overcome this
shortcoming of conventional application-agnostic interconnects by establishing
a programmable interconnect control that dynamically controls the packet flow
in the interconnect based on the communication pattern of applications.

% 課題
Following three challenges have been tackled to achieve the goal described
above: (1) analyzing the packet flow in the interconnect, (2) accelerating MPI
communication by dynamically controlling the packet flow in the interconnect,
and (3) coordinating the execution of application and interconnect control.

% 提案1
To address the first challenge, Chapter~\ref{sec:ii} proposed PFAnalyzer, a
toolset for analyzing the packet flow in the interconnect. When designing and
implementing an efficient programmable interconnect control, researchers need
to conduct a systematic analysis over many combinations of applications and
interconnects. Since performing such an analysis on a physical cluster is
time-consuming, this research utilizes simulation to facilitate the analysis.
The proposed toolset is a pair of tools: an interconnect simulator
specialized for programmable interconnects, and a profiler to collect
communication pattern from applications. PFSim allows researchers and
designers working on interconnects to investigate possible congestion in the
interconnect for an arbitrary cluster configuration and a set of communication
patterns extracted by PFProf. In the evaluation, the accuracy of the
simulation results obtained from PFSim was assessed. Furthermore, how
PFAnalyzer can be used to analyze the effect of programmable interconnect
control was demonstrated.

% 提案2
To address the second challenge, Chapter~\ref{sec:iii} proposed a framework to
accelerate MPI collectives by dynamically controlling the packet flow in the
interconnect. Message Passing Interface~(MPI) is a standardized inter-process
communication library widely used to develop parallel distributed
applications for clusters. Out of the communication primitives provided by
MPI, this research focused on accelerating collective communication because it
occupies a significant fraction of the execution time of applications. The
network programmability provided by Software-Defined Networking was integrated
into MPI collectives in such a way that MPI collectives are able to
effectively utilize the bandwidth of the interconnect. In particular, this
research aimed to reduce the execution time of MPI\_Allreduce, which is a
frequently used MPI collective communication in many simulation codes. The
speedup of MPI\_Allreduce when using the proposed collective acceleration
framework was evaluated.

% 提案3
To address the third challenge, Chapter~\ref{sec:iv} proposed UnisonFlow, a
software-defined coordination mechanism that performs interconnect control in
synchronization with the execution of applications. In real-world
applications, the communication pattern changes with the execution of
application. Therefore, a mechanism to coordinate packet flow control and
execution of application is essential. UnisonFlow is a kernel-assisted
mechanism that realizes such coordination on a per-packet basis while
maintaining significantly low overhead. Evaluation verified that the
interconnect control can be successfully performed in synchronization with the
execution of the application and the overhead imposed by the coordination
mechanism is small.
